# EggTimer App
This app calculates for you the time you need to cook a boiled egg based on how you like it. And sounds an alarm at the end of the time.

I cloned the interface of the app from Angela Yu tutorials. And made some changes the way that i like. 


Here is a screenshot of the EggTimer app.
